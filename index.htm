					<h2 class="subtitle" id="navbar">Abstract</h2>
					<p>Knitting has been a part of my family since I can remember. During
						covid in 2020 I caught the knitting flu and started learning from my
						family. Alongside knitting I was interested in coding and saw a clear
						similarity in the construction of knits and code. In 2021 with guidance
						from tutors at KABK, I made a knitting pattern program that generates
						patterns. Even though I found my patterns interesting in their own right
						I felt they were in some sense worthless due to their creation being
						through the computer. I was curious to see where this feeling came from
						and if it applied to artworks made with computers or if it was a matter
						of how I was perceiving the patterns.</p>
					<p>By looking at the Selburose’s ambiguous historical significance and
						the evolving relationship between humans and machines through knitting,
						I am able to weave the history of knitting with its transformation
						towards industrialisation, the consequential ‘Arts and Crafts movement’
						revolt against the machine which I argue shaped the current view people
						have of artworks created by computers today. As well as arguing that
						approaching computer-generated artworks from a conceptual perspective
						can enrich the work.</p>
					<p>The book <em>Sense of order: A study in psychology of decorative
							art</em> has been my primary source for historical references of
						ornamental art and the book <em>Form + Code: In Design, Art and
							Architecture</em> has shed a light on the history of code and computers
						and its use in the creative field. The artwork of Phillip Stearns called
						<em>Fragmented Memory</em> (2013) has been a great case study for my
						arguments where the many disciplines of code, computer, machine, textile
						and art are merged into one. I draw comparisons and differences of the
						original Selburose and a computer-generated Selburose. Throughout my
						research I’ve been using historical- and exploratory research and
						qualitative methods. Discovering that the original meaning of the rose
						is lost to history yet has adopted many meanings, giving room to
						interpret the computer-generated “selburose” in a new light. Viewing
						them as separate entities it is easier to appreciate each rose on their
						own. The semiotic meaning of the Selburose and its survival through the
						decades and the computer-generated one for its hidden meaning and human
						innovation in technology and computers, making code a contemporary tool
						to aid in art and design.

					<h2 class="subtitle" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
					<p>As you read this text, and depending on the season there is a high
						chance you might be wearing a knitted garment, or at least you own one.
						The garment stored in your closet was most likely made by a mechanical
						knitting machine, knitting rows and rows of yarn in minutes. Some are
						lucky to have handmade garments, painstakingly knitted by hand one knit
						at a time. There is somehow an added value when objects are made by hand
						rather than machines however they both follow the same logic. ‘One plain
						and one purl’ is the most common knitting pattern there is. It could
						also be often knitted in two colours. This binary way of thinking is
						most often associated with the computer where bits are organized into 1
						or 0, ‘On’ or ‘Off’. In this thesis I explore the history of an old well
						known knitting pattern called the Selburose, the history of knitting in
						Iceland, I then compare it to a rose pattern generated by a computer to
						see if there is a devalue or added value that occurs in the process. I
						argue that the Arts and Crafts movement shapes our perceptions of works
						made by the machine but propose a conceptual art mentality to highlight
						the process of the artwork rather than the final product. I’ll be using
						various iterations of the Selburose motif as an example to investigate
						the basic structure of computer-generated art and craftsmanship.
						Arguments made by the Arts and Crafts movement towards the machine as
						well as conceptual art. How can the conceptual approach towards
						computer-generated art change the way in which computer-generated art is
						made, produced and perceived?</p>

						<h3 id="sub_chapter">How knitting and weaving influenced the modern computer</h3>
						<p>Knitting has been a part of every major culture.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
								id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> The
							oldest examples of knits have been found in Egypt dated to the 12th
							century.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
							It is suggested that the craft
							travelled through North-Africa to Spain and the rest of Europe. Knitting
							reached Iceland’s shores around the 16th century by English, German,
							even Dutch sailors, the oldest source mentioning knitting was made in
							1582-1583.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It has also been a strong part of
							their national identity since then. With knitting’s ability to bring
							people together, care for each other by clothing and telling stories
							with and through the knits, thereby enforcing the history. Everybody on
							the farm would participate in the knitting process. From shearing the
							wool, spinning it into thread and knitting it into garments.<a href="#fn4"
								class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
						<p>In those days wool was sheared of sheeps during late- summer or early
							autumn and was spun into yarn later in the winter when farmers and
							workers spent most of their time indoors.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
						<p>The industrialisation of knitting devastated the hand knitters by
							making garments cheaper and faster. It became a turning point for
							knitting in which it changed from a profession to a hobby. The reason
							industrialization was so devastating for knitting was the invention of
							the Jacquard loom in 1804 and other similar mechanical productions of
							knitted goods. The loom was invented by Joseph-Marie Jacquard, a french
							merchant and weaver. With his loom it was possible for unskilled workers
							to weave complex patterns in a matter of minutes which took skilled
							workers to do manually much longer.<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> This affected the method
							and prices of garments making them cheaper in the process. Making
							expensive sought after patterns aquireable by lower classes. The
							groundbreaking element of the loom were its punch cards which made it
							possible to switch between raising and lowering the <em>warp</em> much
							quicker than before. This technology was referenced in the book
							<em>Sketch of The Analytical Engine Invented by Charles Babbage</em>
							where Ada Lovelace a british mathematician compares Babbage’s engine to
							the Jacquard’s loom saying “The Analytical Engine weaves algebraic
							patterns, just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves<a href="#fn7"
								class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> She makes the
							observation due to
							both machines using punching cards. However, in Babbage’s case, he uses
							them not as input for patterns but for numbers. Even though the
							Analytical Engine never became fully realized the same principles were
							used in today’s computers. Using binary language to calculate complex
							problems.

						<h2 class="subtitle">II<br> Seeing a Pattern</h2>
						<h3 id="sub_chapter">Similarities in knitting and coding, comparing coded pattern with knitting pattern						</h3>

						<p>Despite the innovation of the knitting machine, people still knitted
							by hand, even today. The machine managed to turn this once powerful
							asset into a pass-time and hobby. Knitting is a calming repetitive job
							made easy with a set of instructions. These instructions go row by row,
							explaining which knit needs to be knitted or in which colour. Knitting
							consists of two things, yarn and knitting needles, when knitting the
							needles are used to push yarn through loops so a garment is produced.
							The most common knitting stitches are called “plain”and “purl” which are
							represented with the letters “K” for plain knit and “P” for purl knit.
							When knitting with colours often the primary colour will be mentioned as
							“MC” as in ‘Main Colour’ and the secondary colour as “CC” or ‘Contrast-
							Colour’. These pieces of information are often depicted in rows as
							rounds on paper. Like this scarf pattern:<br />

						<p>
							Round 1: *With Main Color (MC), k1; with CC, k7, repeat from * to end of round.<br>
							Round 2: With CC, knit to end of round.<br>
							Round 3: *With CC, k4; with MC, k1; with CC, k7; with MC, k1; with CC, k3, repeat from * to
							end of round.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup><br>
							<em>*note the number after the “k” indicates the number of knits that need to be performed.</em> <br>
						</p>
						<p>This can be correlated to the word <em>algorithm</em> in the context
							of computers, which is usually a set of instructions that a computer
							needs to follow. This practice is not too far off from a simple knitting
							pattern.<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a>
							When writing a program the computer
							must follow a set of instructions line by line - instead of row by row -
							to complete it. As an example here are the first few lines of the
							pattern knitted code developed in 2021 which ignited this thesis.</p>

							<div class="textinpar">
								<p>The Selburose pattern is known by many names for example ‘the
							eight-leaf rose’ or ‘the eight-pointed star’ but got its current name
							from Selbu, a town located in Norway where in 1851 a young girl named
							Marit Guldsetbrua Emstad knitted a pair of mittens for her church and on
							the back palm had the rose decorated in black and white. This pattern
							became an instant hit among the townsfolk and it is said to have gained
							popularity in knitting around the world thanks to Selbu - and Norway’s -
							export of knitted goods.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a> This story is most
							often associated with the Selburose’s rise to fame however it is not the
							pattern’s origin. It is depicted in the book <em>Sjónabókin - Icelandic
								Patterns and Ornaments</em><a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a> which holds patterns
							and ornaments found in Iceland since the 16th century including the
							Selburose, which predates the one made in 1851. The earliest example of
							this geometric octagram found during this research is in the archive of
							the British Museum; there are many instances of the Selburose in
							different variations, cultures, context and material, however, the
							oldest example found was dated 2000 BC - 1000 BC and can be found on a
							stamp seal from the Mesompotamian era.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a>
							Stamp seals were usually made to leave an impression on wet clay for
							storytelling purposes and the rose is depicted in a landscape setting
							most possibly representing a star rather than a rose. A more
							recognisable and geometric form of the Selburose can be found on a
							sheath found in Britain during the Roman Empire rule in mid 1st century
							BC. In that instance it is natural to presume that the pattern is a star
							rather than a rose. The sheath has two circular decorations above and
							below it and the description mentions a “crescent moon” on the upper
							panel.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>

						<figcaption>Stamp-Seal dated 2000 BC - 1000 BC showing the Selburose</figcaption>

						<p>The set of instructions to knit and code are not the only thing they
							have in common. There are countless knitting magazines that have been
							produced in Iceland and when looking at an illustration of a knitting
							pattern they are usually depicted on a grid sheet of paper with each
							square filled either black or white depending on where MC or CC should
							go. As seen in fig 1. depicts a mitten pattern found in the knitting
							magazine “Hugur og Hönd” with a common knitting pattern called the
							<em>Selburose</em>. This binary depiction of the pattern can easily be
							interpreted as pixels on a screen made by a coded program.
						</p>
						
						<p>Despite the rose’s <em>ambiguous</em> cultural and historical meaning
							it is still knitted today with many people connecting it with Christmas,
							winter or even the country of Norway.<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
						<p>It is probably no surprise why the Selburose pattern was made. The
							first patterns made by humans are mostly based on their surroundings and
							objects which were beautiful for them, so there is no wonder why most
							patterns, ornaments and motifs are based on nature, plants, flowers and
							even stars. Perhaps it is because of nature’s inherent beauty and
							ever-changing seasons. However, rarely is nature as structured as most
							knitting patterns, so some human intervention for rule and order is
							implemented.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> It could be argued the reason the
							Selburose has a strong connotation to christmas is due to its
							resemblance to the poinsettias flower which bloom around christmas time.
							Due to the cold weather of the season knitted goods are greatly
							appreciated. The patterns knitted were often depicted as black and white
							boxes, which look visually similar to pixels on the screen.</p>

						<p>In the book <em>Form + Code in design, art, and architecture</em>
							Casey Reas exclaims that the use of code in art can be put into two
							categories, none of which is lesser than the other, they are
							<em>production</em> and <em>conception</em>.<a href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref"
								id="fnref16" role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a>
							Back in the 19th-century production was the main focus of machines but
							as they evolved into home computers their skills broadened towards
							conception, or forming an idea. This view was best captured by the words
							of A. Micheal Noll “an intellectual and active creative partner that
							when fully exploited could be used to produce wholly new art forms and
							possibly new aesthetic experiences”.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> He compares the
							computer to a partner in which new territories in the art can be
							explored, broadening our forms of expression through art.
						</p>
						<p>Because of the computers inherent capability of being able to perform
							the same calculations over and over again displaying the output in a
							binary - pixel like output imitating a knitting pattern. I wanted to
							merge these two disciplines into one. By creating a program that
							generates knitting patterns based on an <em>l-system</em> - ,
							<em>recursion</em> and mirroring pixels I was able to generate countless
							patterns based on random input. In reality the program’s output is
							actually a <em>motif</em> which is the fundamental building block of a
							pattern, without a motif, there is no pattern. It is not until you
							repeat that motif multiple times when a pattern emerges.<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref"
								id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
							As mentioned earlier every pattern has an input which was made in
							<em>binary</em>, - or 1 and 0. This input can be random <em>strings</em>
							of 1 and 0 however it can also be based on any <em>character
								encoding</em> that uses binary input, for example like the ASCII binary
							alphabet or morse code. That type of code can be described as
							<em>transcoding</em> - where one type of digital material is converted
							into another.<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>19</sup></a>
						</p>
					</div>
				</div>
						<p>In the knitting pattern program mentioned earlier the binary inputs
							represent two <em>functions</em> which is a reusable code that is used
							to perform a single, related action. In this program 1 represents “draw
							a pixel and move up by one pixel” and 0 means “go up by one pixel”.
							Starting from the middle it then mirrors these instructions until the
							string of 1 and 0 have finished.</p>
						<p>With this new found way of transcoding information into a motif it is
							interesting to compare a well known knitting pattern with its
							computer-generated counterpart. That is why the word “selburose” was
							chosen with its long history from knitting; it would be a good fit to
							compare it to the computer-generated one. The generated pattern was made
							before the discovery of the Selburose ambiguous history which opens up
							new sets of questions about the value of art. And if the way we look at
							art from different perspectives can change the way we de- or add value
							to them. When did we start making art with computers and how did it
							affect us to make art with computers today?</p>

						<h2 class="subtitle">III <br> This is not a rose</h2>
						<h3 id="sub_chapter">Textiles, the medium of imagery</h3>
						<div class="quote" style="text-align: center;">
							<p>“Form which is not taken from natural objects are ugly” <a href="#fn20" class="footnote-ref" id="fn20" role="doc-noteref"><sup> 20</sup></a></p>
						</div>
						<p>These are the words written by the English writer John Ruskin. Born
							in 1819 he was associated with the Arts and Crafts movement. The
							movement focused on reforming design and decoration as a
							counter-movement towards rapid industrialisation. William Morris -
							another follower of the movement - continues in his text to argue the
							increased profit greed and less attention to detail will result in the
							overall quality of a work being diminished.<a href="#fn21" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref21"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>21</sup></a>
							This was also expanded by William Morris in his paper <em>Hope and Fears
								of Art</em> saying “…everything made by man’s hands has a form, which
							must be either beautiful or ugly; beautiful if it is in accord with
							Nature, and helps her; ugly if it is discordant with Nature, and thwarts
							her; it cannot be indifferent…”<a href="#fn22" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref22"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>22</sup></a> It is hard to argue
							that the machine is in fact natural due to its many mystical properties
							and Morris’ words seem to suggest that the machine and therefore
							computers will never make beautiful art because of their lack of
							connection towards nature. The industrial revolution had the beneficial
							effect that clothes, furniture and other status symbols became ever more
							acquirable for the lower- and middle-class citizens. These new
							productions however lacked in quality, so much so that Alexis de
							Tocquville wrote in 1812 about the effect of workmanship made by Percier
							and Fontaine “a look of brilliance unannounced to its true worth”
							“appear as something he is not” which sheds a light that machine-made
							decorations are inherently ugly.<a href="#fn23" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref23"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
						<p>However, that does not diminish the machine’s potential. As Frank
							Lloyd Wright, mostly known as an architect, indicates in his essay from
							1901. Wright mostly criticised Morris for his narrow view on machines
							and tries to highlight its benefits for human labour, innovation and the
							future. Using the printer as an example, which in many ways is a
							machine, calling it the first great machine after a great city. The
							machine, Wright writes, is a “tool which frees human labour, lengthens
							and broadens the life of the simplest man.”<a href="#fn24" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref24"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>24</sup></a>
							By that, he means that the machine should be looked at as a tool to aid
							persons in their projects. He goes on saying that in every age there
							have been tools which humans have used freely to express themselves in
							art “…the tool most successful in saving the most precious thing in the
							world - human effort”. This can be compared to today’s use of computers,
							where we have found ways to simplify otherwise complex and repetitive
							tasks, saving both time and energy with the added benefit of making it
							more accessible for a greater number of people. That can be seen in the
							computer program that generates knitting patterns as well as the
							knitting machine which produces the garment much quicker and easier than
							by human hands.</p>
							<img src="content/images/CAN_Images_cropped.jpg" alt="CAN" width="100%">
						<figcaption> 7. Sample images generated by style classification CAN model, a
							variant of CAN with style classification loss and without the style
							ambiguity loss. The images show recognizable genres such as portraits,
							landscapes, etc.</figcaption>
						<p>This view of the machine still echoes until this day. With the
							development of tools such as <em>artificial intelligence</em>, some
							computer scientists have made a program that generates paintings based
							on various styles found in museums around the world, for example
							landscapes, portraits and still life. Alumni at the The Art &amp; AI
							Laboratory in Rutgers University are behind the developments of such a
							program. The output of the paintings are mostly colourful abstract
							shapes that echo what the program was fed as real examples. Their
							conclusion was “The system was evaluated by human subject experiments
							which showed that human subjects regularly confused the generated art
							with the human art, and sometimes rated the generated art higher on
							various high-level scales.” However the researchers did note that “…it
							[the computer] does not have any semantic understanding of art behind
							the concept of styles.” Leaving all the art open for interpretation by
							the humans observing it.<a href="#fn25" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref25"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>25</sup></a> Without semantics it
							is hard to have a meaningful discussion about art. When observing the
							portrait section of the generated art there is an eerie feel to it,
							almost uncanny they recable a melted ghost screaming for their lives,
							frozen in the painted frame forever (see Fig 7.). It is hard not to
							think about the Arts and Crafts Movement quote about nature and how by
							imitating it through a machine it therefore becomes ugly. In this case
							computers do save time and energy when it comes to painting but quicker
							does not mean better. But in return we may ask if time and energy
							<em>does</em> increase the artworks value?

						<p>Making art with the machine or computers which does not try to
							emulate nature but create new perspectives is perfectly illustrated in
							the artwork <em>Fragmented Memory</em> (2013) by Phillip David Stearns.
							This triptych woven artworks made from Stearns computer’s physical
							memory and woven at the TextileMuseum Tilburg memorialise his computer’s
							data in fabric. It divides the data into 6 bits which is then assigned a
							RGB colour value - transcoding the data into colours. On the back there
							is the <em>key</em> to the encryption which in theory would make it
							possible to decode the information presented on the front of the
							fabric.</p>
						<p>“Textiles have long been used as a medium for imagery but are also
							closely connected to the development of automation and computer
							technology. Fragmented Memory collapses these two histories, functioning
							as a visual and physical medium for the storage and transmission of
							digital information.”</p>
						<p>Rafaël Rozendaal is a Dutch-Brazilian visual artist currently working
							in New York. In his work <em>Abstract Browsing</em> Rozendaal explores
							the abstraction of a common computer-browser by using a plug-in. When
							activated the browser becomes a random collection of colourful
							rectangles. “It shows you the skeleton of the web. It’s like seeing an
							X-ray of a building, showing the structural elements.” Since computers,
							phones and other electronics have become such an integrated part of our
							lives there is full reason to speculate how to preserve all this
							information. The obvious solution is to copy everything and store it in
							a safe place but it’s quite unpredictable how long this data will
							last.<a href="#fn27" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref27" role="doc-noteref"><sup>27</sup></a>
							Rozendaal went a step further with
							his <em>Abstract Browsing</em> and weaved it into carpets. His reasoning
							is that weaving is a sort of “mechanical painting”.<a href="#fn28" class="footnote-ref"
								id="fnref28" role="doc-noteref"><sup>28</sup></a>
							Just as the paintbrush transfers ideas of the artists onto the canvas,
							the Jacquard loom transfers data into the woven material.</p>
						<p>By allowing the computer to determine the outcome of the piece with a
							common language and medium that both computers and humans could
							understand, Stearns manages to bridge the gap between humans and
							machines. This steers away from the shallow re-creations of the CAN
							program mentioned earlier. This way of looking at computers and arts
							could be compared with the “truth of material” a principle by
							Redgraves<a href="#fn29" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref29"
								role="doc-noteref"><sup>29</sup></a> which believes that the innate
							qualities of the materials should influence the projects created from
							them. By using computers as a tool to create art based on its
							capabilities instead of relying on pre-know aspects made by humans we
							can start to see it from a conceptual art point of view. In conceptual
							art, the idea or concept coupled with the artwork is seen as the most
							important aspect of the artwork<a href="#fn30" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref30"

								<br>-Sol LeWitt
							</p>
						</div>
						<p>Sol LeWitt’s quote ties in perfectly when we look again at the two
							categories of code in art, where code becomes the conception of the
							artwork rather than the production. The construction of code has a
							similar process to conceptual art where you have to define all
							parameters before executing the program that will in the end produce the
							artwork. In his text <em>Art after Philosophy</em> Joseph Kosuth writes
							about aesthetics “ it’s important to separate aesthetics from art
							because aesthetics deals with opinions and perceptions of the world in
							general”. He goes on to say that ornament’s main reason to be is purely
							for aesthetic purposes, to make something look more attractive than it
							is. Formalist criticism on art is only based on its physical attributes
							and bypasses its conceptual element. “formalist art becomes art only by
							virtue of its resemblance to earlier works of art”.<a href="#fn32" class="footnote-ref"
								id="fnref32" role="doc-noteref"><sup>32</sup></a>
							The artisans of the old used aesthetics as a crutch to sell their art.
							Conceptual art tries to interrupt the process of art. To highlight the
							process rather than the final work not relying on aesthetics and
							ornaments but the idea that made the artwork come to life. . It then is
							not a question about beauty of the artwork but questioning what
							<em>is</em> art?.

						<h3 id="sub_chapter">A conclusion</h3>
						<p>Knitting has been a part of Icelandic culture for a few hundred
							years, establishing itself as a reliable, cheap and easy way of making
							garments. Through the knitted garments people started developing
							patterns based on objects found in nature, which could soon be recreated
							by the machine during the industrial revolution. This sudden shift in
							production shocked the Arts and Crafts movement prompting them to
							organise a rebellion towards the machine and declaring everything made
							by it to be ugly and fearing it would diminish the quality of art. The
							Arts and Crafts movement failed to see the potential of the machine as a
							tool to aid human innovation as Wright pointed out. When looking at
							artworks where modern computers imitate portraits and landscapes usually
							made by hand, as in the case of the CAN program, I agree with the Arts
							and Crafts movement’s argument that its shortcomings lay in them trying
							to imitate nature and therefore being ulgy. But as well as losing the
							semiotics and the valuable process of the artwork which conceptual
							artists would deem of higher importance.</p>
						<p>Pinning computers against humans is an unfair comparison because
							machines will never be human and humans will never be machines. That is
							why artworks made by Stearns and Rozendaal stand much taller, their way
							of approaching the machine as a tool or a collaborator, knowing its
							potential, limitation as well as highlighting the production of the
							artwork and finding a fitting format to display those artworks echoes
							the chant from the conceptual artists of the 1960s. Illustrated
							perfectly in the quote by Sol leWitt where “…The idea becomes a machine
							that makes the art”.</p>
						<p>When approaching computer-generated art conceptually there is value
							added to the work. When something is handmade there is an aspect of
							craftsmanship, time, energy and expertise. When something is made by the
							computer it is assumed it was made without any effort and robbed
							potential craftsmen. Yet there are humans always behind every machine
							and even code has a certain craftsmanship behind it. Patterns in
							knitting have often been overlooked in their potential meaning. Often
							used to decorate and enrich a design rather than be the main aspect of
							it. By looking at the process of the pattern, how it was made, what it
							means and the medium used to display it can all have an effect on its
							value. Nothing is born with value, value comes with time, and grows with
							its use.</p>
						<p>In this thesis I talk about a rose, but this thesis isn’t about the
							rose, but cultural value and human innovation. Looking back at how we
							have viewed our innovations in art and rebelled against them. Today we
							stand at a similar crossroads with technology advancing further and
							faster than ever before. The way we value art made by or with a computer
							will become an important foundation for future artists and art critics.
							The Selburose has its culture, aesthetics, its beauty and comfort that
							can be found from its familiarity and history and its endless
							appreciation from countless cultures. The computer-generated selburose
							can be appreciated by its conceptual elements: The fascination of human
							innovation in machinery, the almost mystical properties of the computer
							and the computer as a tool to aid in the design process. That is how we
							can both appreciate the art of the old and the art to come.</p>
